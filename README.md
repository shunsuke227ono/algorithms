Solutions for problems from programing competitions. Each source code includes its question as well.

## Data Structures

### Binary Tree

- mirror_binary_tree
I solve problem by creating binary tree and swapping each node's children. But I might have better handle the input array itself, then just make nodes line in opposite order at each level. (In this way, I dont have to construct tree.)

## Algorithms

### Dynamic Programming

- coin_change.rb
Typical DP problem.
